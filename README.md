This my playground with Design Pattern Adapter. This code was built based on [Design Patterns - Adapter Pattern](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/adapter_pattern.htm) post and in my others repositories about Jackson and GSON and this pattern ([Adapter Pattern Example](https://github.com/leandrocgsi/adapter-pattern-example) and [Adapter Pattern Converter Example](https://github.com/leandrocgsi/adapter-pattern-converter-example)).
